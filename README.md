- **Modular feature folders** (`admin`, `portal`, `booking`, `services`, `tasks`, etc.) with colocated hooks, providers, and tests.
- **Netlify Functions** for scheduled jobs (cron reminders, telemetry, health monitoring) with shared scripts in `scripts/`.
- **ClamAV sidecar service** (`clamav-service/`) for antivirus scanning of uploaded documents.
- **Monitoring assets** in `monitoring/` and Sentry instrumentation for observability.
- **Extensive automation scripts** in `scripts/` covering migrations, RLS setup, backfills, and maintenance.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive admin dashboards with performance metrics, KPIs, and realtime panels.
- End-to-end booking management, including availability planning, reminders, invoicing, and analytics.
- Advanced task workspace featuring board, calendar, table, list, and Gantt views plus bulk operations.
- Multi-channel communications: chat console, notifications, newsletters, and automated email flows.
- Service request triage with workload, distribution charts, and SLA tracking.
- Client self-service portal with unified dashboard, business setup wizard, compliance tracking, financial overview, and secure document management.
- Internationalization (English, Arabic RTL, Hindi) with extensible locale registry.
- Scheduled processes for reminders, telemetry, and data hygiene via cron routes and Netlify functions.

```

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or newer.
- pnpm 10 (project uses the pnpm workspace lockfile and scripts).
- PostgreSQL 15+ (Supabase or Neon works out of the box).
- Optional: Redis or Upstash for realtime/pub-sub adapters.
- Optional: SendGrid, Stripe, Sentry, Netlify, and Slack credentials for extended features.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file (or configure environment variables through your platform). Minimum required variables align with `scripts/check-required-envs.sh`:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` or `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `FROM_EMAIL` | Default outbound sender address |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | NextAuth signing secret |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Base URL for generating callbacks |

Common optional variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | Production email delivery |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Auth token for cron endpoints and functions |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Payment flows |
| `REDIS_URL` or `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Caching and realtime adapters |
| `UPLOADS_PROVIDER`, `NETLIFY_BLOBS_TOKEN` | File storage provider selection |
| `UPLOADS_AV_SCAN_URL` | External antivirus scan endpoint |
| `REALTIME_PG_URL`, `REALTIME_PG_CHANNEL`, `REALTIME_TRANSPORT` | Realtime event propagation |
| `MULTI_TENANCY_ENABLED` | Guard rails for tenant scoping |
| `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | Error and performance telemetry |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_FETCH`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FETCH_TIMEOUT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` | Client networking debug knobs |
| `PERF_BUDGET_LCP_MS`, `PERF_BUDGET_CLS` | Performance budget thresholds in tests |
| `PREVIEW_URL`, `PREVIEW_SESSION_COOKIE`, `PREVIEW_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `PREVIEW_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Preview environment smoke testing |
| `E2E_BASE_URL`, `ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN`, `E2E_SERVICE_ID` | Playwright end-to-end suite configuration |

Run the validator when variables change:
```bash
pnpm check:env
```

Note: Prisma `datasource db` uses `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` by default. On non-Netlify environments, set `DATABASE_URL` and map it to `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` in your process manager or provide `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` directly.

### Database Setup
```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push
```

### Seed Data
```bash
pnpm db:seed
```

### Run the App
```bash
pnpm dev
```
Visit http://localhost:3000 to access the web application.

## Testing & Quality
- **Unit & Integration:** Vitest with mocks in `__mocks__/` and `tests/`.
- **End-to-End:** Playwright specs in `e2e/tests/`; configurable base URL and credentials (Chromium-only on Netlify via plugin).
- **Performance Budgets:** `tests/thresholds.test.ts` enforces LCP/CLS targets.
- **Accessibility & Layout:** Admin layout tests ensure SSR safety and environment-specific behavior.
- **CI Recommendations:** Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and targeted suites before deploys.

## Integrations & Services
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js (`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) with Prisma adapter and role-based access control.
- **Payments:** Stripe endpoints under `src/app/api/payments` and invoice helpers.
- **Email:** SendGrid via `@sendgrid/mail` with fallbacks when not configured.
- **Uploads:** Netlify Blobs provider support plus antivirus scanning pipeline.
- **Realtime:** Optional Redis/Upstash-backed adapters in `src/lib/realtime-enhanced.ts`.
- **Scheduling:** Netlify cron functions (`netlify/functions/cron-*`) and `/api/cron/*` routes.
- **Analytics & Monitoring:** Sentry configs (`sentry.*.config.ts`) and dashboards under `monitoring/`.

## API Overview
Key groups (see `src/app/api` for handlers):
- Public content and utilities: `/api/posts`, `/api/pricing`, `/api/currencies`, `/api/tools/*`.
- Auth & user: `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`, `/api/users/*`, canonical dev-only login: `/api/_dev/login` (requires DEV_LOGIN_TOKEN and IP gating in non-local environments).
- Bookings: `/api/bookings/*`, `/api/bookings/[id]/*`, `/api/ws/bookings`.
- Admin: `/api/admin/*` including analytics, bookings, services, tasks, stats, settings, permissions, team, uploads quarantine.
- Portal: `/api/portal/*` for client-facing bookings and service requests.
- Payments & invoices: `/api/payments/*`, `/api/admin/invoices/*`.
- Cron & monitoring: `/api/cron/*`, `/api/monitoring`, `/api/security/*`, `/api/admin/system/health`.
- OpenAPI: `/api/openapi/admin-services` exposes admin-services schema.

## Deployment
- **Vercel:** Default target. Use `pnpm vercel:build`. Configure environment variables and run Prisma migrations post-deploy (`pnpm db:push`, `pnpm db:seed`).
- **Netlify:** `netlify.toml` sets build and enables `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` and a custom E2E plugin. Set `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` (or alias from `DATABASE_URL`), optional `RUN_DB_MIGRATIONS=true` to auto-migrate/seed.
- **Docker / ECS:** See `DEPLOYMENT.md`. Ensure Prisma client generation occurs in build stage and that migrations run with sufficient advisory lock timeouts.
- **Self-Hosted:** Provision Node.js 18+, PostgreSQL, and optional Redis/Sentry. Use `scripts/setup-rls.ts` and other scripts for database hardening.

## Monitoring & Operations
- **Sentry:** Client, server, and edge configs ready for DSN wiring.
- **Health Checks:** `netlify/functions/health-monitor.ts` and `scripts/monitoring` assets for uptime alerts (Slack/email).
- **Cron & Automation:** `scripts/production-monitoring.js`, `scripts/health-check.js`, and `/api/cron/*` endpoints cover reminders, telemetry, and cleanups.

## Security & Compliance
- **Access Control:** Role-based guard rails, tenant scoping, and admin layout stores ensure principle-of-least-privilege across app and API layers.
- **Data Protection:** Prisma tenant filter utilities, Zod validation, and multi-tenancy flags protect database reads/writes.
- **Uploads Safety:** ClamAV microservice, quarantine management UI, and provider abstraction for blob storage.
- **Secrets & Transport:** Cron secrets, Stripe webhook validation, Sentry DSN configuration, and optional Redis/Upstash tokens are all environment driven.

## Audit Summary
- Codebase is modular and follows feature-based boundaries; APIs are comprehensive and colocated under `src/app/api`.
- Env validation is robust (`scripts/check-required-envs.sh`), with Netlify-aware defaults and CI branches.
- Testing stack covers unit/integration and E2E; performance thresholds are enforced.
- Deployment targets (Vercel/Netlify) are configured with sensible defaults and optional E2E in production context.

## Recommended Improvements
- Adopt a single source of truth for DB URL (introduce `DATABASE_URL` in Prisma `datasource` with conditional mapping in runtime config) to reduce confusion outside Netlify.
- Add a LICENSE file or clarify licensing policy referenced in this README.
- Expand OpenAPI coverage (beyond admin-services) and publish schema artifacts for client SDK generation.
- Introduce a security scan step (Semgrep or similar) in CI and document remediation workflow in `docs/`.
- Add a developer "quickstart" seed that provisions a demo tenant, services, and sample data for faster onboarding.
