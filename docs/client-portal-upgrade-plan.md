# Client Portal Upgrade Plan (UAE • KSA • Egypt)

A comprehensive, phased implementation plan to upgrade the client portal for a multi-country tax platform. The plan aligns features visible in the reference UI with the needs of a tax-filing product and adapts them to regulatory requirements of UAE, KSA, and Egypt.

---

## 1) Snapshot: What the reference UI conveys and how it maps to a tax portal

Key elements observed in the provided screenshot and recommended mapping:

- Left sidebar menu (Messaging, Current Account, Payment Gateway, Corporate Cards, Connected Banking, Trademark, Documents)
  - Messaging → Secure in-portal conversations, cases, and task threads per filing period.
  - Current Account / Connected Banking → Bank feeds for reconciliation and cash/expense evidence supporting returns (read-only). Regional support for local banks.
  - Payment Gateway → Client invoices, online payments for firm fees; links to government payment references (FTA/ZATCA/ETA portals) when applicable.
  - Corporate Cards → Receipts inbox; OCR to tag VAT or deductible categories; optional.
  - Trademark → Replace with “Registrations & Certificates” (TRN, ZATCA e-invoice device IDs, ETA profile, ESR submissions, commercial registration documents).
  - Documents → Source-of-truth document vault with folders by Entity→Year→Tax Type.

- Top navigation (Dashboard, Accounts, Updates, Teams, AI Agents, Billing, Support)
  - Dashboard → Filing calendar, upcoming/overdue actionables, return status widgets.
  - Accounts → Entities & People; client teams and permissions.
  - Updates → Compliance alerts (rate changes, schema changes like ZATCA Phase-2, ETA updates), and product release notes.
  - Teams → Client-side user management (owners, finance, auditor access). 
  - AI Agents → Assisted intake, doc classification, compliance Q&A, checklist generation.
  - Billing → Firm billing and client invoices, payment methods, credit balance.
  - Support → Knowledge base, tickets, SLA status, live chat.

- Center content (Entities/People tabs, empty state, search, new buttons)
  - Entities ↔ client companies; People ↔ individual taxpayers and authorized users.
  - Deep search across entities, returns, invoices, docs.
  - “+” actions to add Entity/Person; smart templates by country.

- Right panel (Business Actionables → Upcoming/Renewals)
  - Filing deadlines and renewals: VAT returns, Corporate Tax, Zakat (KSA), ESR (UAE), Withholding Tax (KSA), E-invoice device renewals (KSA), activity renewals (Egypt: e-invoicing profile/ETA obligations).

- Other elements: Dark theme, notifications, quick sign out, privacy badge, chat bubble
  - Maintain dark theme with accessible color contrast. Notifications unify portal, email, and WhatsApp/SMS (opt-in).

---

## 2) Product Goals

- Single portal for clients across UAE, KSA, Egypt to manage tax obligations, returns, payments, and compliance artifacts.
- Reduce back-and-forth via messaging, structured tasks, and automated intake.
- Provide audit-ready, immutable records (docs, approvals, timelines).
- Minimize regional friction with country-specific automations and checklists.

---

## 3) Regulatory Landscape (country highlights)

- UAE
  - VAT (FTA): 5% VAT returns, refund claims, voluntary disclosures, ESR notifications/reports, Corporate Tax (9% effective now) returns.
  - TRN validation, FTA e-Services flows (link-out for payment/submission with tracked references).
- KSA
  - ZATCA VAT (15%), Zakat (for certain entities), Withholding Tax, e-Invoicing (Phase-2, integration compliance: reporting/clearance, device and CSR/CRT management), e-archiving requirements.
- Egypt
  - ETA VAT and e-Invoicing clearance, e-Receipt for B2C, withholding/stamp where applicable; identity and certificate management.

Implications: separate templates, calendars, validations, and evidentiary document sets per country; configurable per entity.

---

## 4) Information Architecture

- Tenancy
  - Tenant = client group; Entity = legal company or individual taxpayer; People = users or directors; Advisors = firm users.
- Primary Objects
  - Entity profiles: country, registrations (TRN/ZATCA/ETA), activity, fiscal calendar.
  - Filing cycles: VAT, Corporate Tax, Zakat, ESR, WHT, e-Invoice obligations.
  - Documents: categories (invoices, bank statements, contracts, payroll, fixed assets, tax adjustments), retention rules.
  - Tasks & checklists: per filing period, per obligation.
  - Payments & invoices: firm invoices, official references, reconciliation.
  - Messages & tickets: case threads tied to returns and tasks.
  - Banking connections: read-only transactions, statement fetch, receipts OCR pipeline.
  - Notifications: digest, deadline alerts, missing-evidence reminders.

---

## 5) Phased Implementation Plan

Each phase includes objectives, key tasks, acceptance criteria, and dependencies. Use feature flags for safe rollout. Adopt a country-by-country vertical slice approach when needed.

### Phase 0 — Foundations (Architecture, Security, Localization)
- Objectives
  - Harden multi-tenancy; enforce RLS; country-aware settings; Arabic/English i18n; timezones; currencies; dark/light modes.
- Key Tasks
  - RBAC: roles (Client Owner, Finance, Viewer, Auditor, Advisor), scoped to Tenant/Entity.
  - Country config registry (UAE/KSA/EGY) with obligations, calendars, forms, validation rules.
  - Activity log + audit trails; data retention policies by country.
  - Observability: Sentry, performance metrics, structured logs, alerting.
- Acceptance
  - All pages respect tenant + role scoping; language toggle; unit/integration tests for RLS and RBAC.

### Phase 1 — Entities & People (replaces Entities/People tabs)
- Tasks
  - Entity creation wizard per country (collect TRN/TIN, registration certificates, fiscal year, VAT status).
  - People management with invitations and 2FA; role assignment; KYC verification.
  - Search across entities and people; bulk import.
- Acceptance
  - Create/edit/archive entities; invite users; permission matrix enforced.

### Phase 1.1 — Business Account Setup Wizard (Modal)
- Purpose
  - Allow clients to create a business account from a focused modal, matching the reference UI: two tabs (Existing Entity Setup, New Entity Setup), country flag indicator, license-number driven verification, consent checkbox, prominent primary CTA, support partner label, and chat link.
- UX Requirements
  - Modal overlay with focus trap, ESC to close, and ARIA roles (dialog, aria-labelledby/aria-describedby). Keyboard-only and screen-reader friendly. Persist dark theme.
  - Tabs: "Existing Entity Setup" (search/verify existing registrations and auto-link) and "New Entity Setup" (create new entity with license details).
  - Fields (UAE default): License Number, Business Name, Economic Department/Free Zone (select), TRN (optional at creation), Legal Form (LLC, Sole Establishment, etc.), Incorporation Date, Attachments (trade license PDF/JPG, certificate). Terms consent checkbox with link to agreement. CTA text: "Set up Business".
  - Helpers: country switcher (UAE/KSA/EGY), inline validation messages, empty-state copy on mismatch, support partner label, live chat link.
- Regional Variants
  - UAE: Validate DED/Free-zone license, TRN format (15 digits), ESR applicability flag, Corporate Tax applicability.
  - KSA: CR Number, VAT Registration Number, optional Zakat flag; no e-invoice device at setup; city/region selector.
  - Egypt: Tax ID (TIN), ETA profile number, activity code (GPC/industry), e-Invoicing obligation flag.
- Validation & Integrations
  - Real-time license lookup adapters (pluggable): UAE (DED + major free zones), KSA (MC / CR), Egypt (GAFI/ETA where permitted). Fallback to manual verification workflow.
  - TRN/VAT/TIN checksum validation, name similarity (Levenshtein) with license record; duplicate-entity prevention and merge suggestion.
  - File uploads scanned for malware; OCR to prefill Business Name and number.
- Data Model Additions
  - entity_licenses(id, entity_id, country, authority, license_number, legal_form, issued_at, expires_at, economic_zone_id, status, metadata).
  - entity_registrations(id, entity_id, type[TRN/ZATCA/ETA/WHT/ZAKAT], value, verified_at, source, status).

  - verification_attempts(id, type[license|tax_id], value, country, status, result, attempted_by, attempted_at, correlation_id).
- API Design
  - POST /api/entities/setup (idempotent with Idempotency-Key header). Payload: country, tab, license_number, business_name, economic_zone_id, legal_form, registrations[], attachments[], consent_version.
  - GET /api/registries/:country/license/:number → normalized license record; cache with TTL and ETag; rate limiting.
  - POST /api/consents → record explicit consent with IP/UA; linked to entity/user.
  - Emits audit events: entity.setup.requested, entity.setup.verified, entity.setup.completed, entity.setup.failed.
- Security & Privacy
  - RLS on all tables by tenant/entity; encrypted columns for IDs/certificates; redact PII in logs.
