## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Filter State Shape
```typescript
interface FilterState {
  search: string      // User's search query
  role: string | null // Selected role (or null for "All")
  status: string | null // Selected status (or null for "All")
}

interface FilterStats {
  totalCount: number     // Total users in system
  filteredCount: number  // Users matching filters
  isFiltered: boolean    // Whether any filter is active
}
```

### Data Flow Architecture
```
UsersTableWrapper
  ├── useFilterState(context.users)
  │   ├── filterState: FilterState
  │   ├── filteredUsers: UserItem[]
  │   ├── stats: FilterStats
  │   └── updateFilter, clearFilters functions
  │
  └── UserDirectoryFilterBar
      ├── Props: filters, handlers, stats
      ├── Emits: onFiltersChange, onSelectAll, onClearFilters
      └── Displays: Counter, Clear button, Selection state
```

### Filtering Logic (Client-Side)
```typescript
// Memoized filtering in useFilterState
const filteredUsers = useMemo(() => {
  let result = users
  
  // Client-side filtering using useFilterUsers hook
  // Searches: name, email, phone (NEW), company
  // Filters by role and status with AND logic
  
  return result
}, [users, filters])
```

### API Integration
```typescript
// Server-side filtering available via GET /api/admin/users/search
// Query params:
// - search: searches name, email, phone, position, department
// - role: exact match filter
// - status: exact match filter
// - page, limit: pagination
```

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **useFilterState hook** - Centralized filter management, not in context (keeps scope local to component)
2. **Client-side filtering** - Uses useMemo for performance, suitable for typical user counts
3. **Component composition** - Separate concerns (filter bar, table, selection)
4. **State updates** - Callback-based, no Redux/Context overhead for simple filters

### Trade-offs Made
- **Single-select filters** (MVP) vs Multi-select (Enterprise)
  - Simpler UI, covers 95% of use cases
  - Easy to extend for multi-select in Phase 2
  
- **Client-side filtering** (default) vs Server-side (available)
  - Better UX for typical datasets (< 10k users)
  - Server-side API available for large datasets

- **Sticky filter bar** vs Docked panel
  - Better UX, consistent filtering interface
  - Matches modern web application standards

### Known Limitations
1. Phone search doesn't support formatting (e.g., searches literal input)
   - Enhancement: Could add phone formatter for normalized search
   
2. No filter history or presets in MVP
   - Enhancement: Add localStorage + UI for saved filters
   
3. No advanced search operators
   - Enhancement: Add support for "exact match", "starts with", etc.
