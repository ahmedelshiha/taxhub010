## 🎯 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Understand the Goal
The Portal-Admin integration transforms the system from:
- ❌ **Before**: Two separate systems (Portal reads, Admin writes)
- ✅ **After**: Unified bi-directional system (Portal actively contributes, Admin has real-time visibility)

### Step 2: Know Your Resources
- **Total Tasks**: 240+
- **Total Effort**: ~450-500 hours (5 FTE × 18 weeks)
- **Team Size**: 3-5 developers
- **Phases**: 6 phases (3 weeks each)

### Step 3: Start Here
```
1. Read IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md (this tells you HOW)
2. Read PORTAL_ADMIN_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md (this tells you WHY)
3. Reference PORTAL_ADMIN_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP_todo.md (this tells you WHAT to do)
4. Check docs/portal/ (this shows you EXAMPLES)
5. Start Phase 1, Task 1.1.1
```
